## Description of SQL Query and Usage of CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

This SQL query is used to retrieve information about horror genre movies that:
- are highly rented,
- have a duration of over 100 minutes and
- have a rental price below $1.

### Usage of CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

CTEs are used to create **temporary tables** containing data relevant to the main query. In this case, two CTEs are defined:

1. **peliculas_rentadas**: This CTE counts the number of times each movie has been rented, grouped by movie ID.
2. **peliculas_categoria_horror**: This CTE identifies movies belonging to the "Horror" genre.

### Main Query

The main query combines the CTEs and the movies table to obtain the desired results. Several columns from the movies table are selected, along with columns from the CTEs. Additionally, other filters are applied using the WHERE clause to ensure that only movies meeting the specified criteria are selected.

### Executing the Query

To execute this query, simply copy and paste the SQL code into your preferred database engine (mine is PostgreSQL 16.2ðŸ˜‰)
